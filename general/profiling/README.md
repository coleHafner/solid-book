# Profiling Websites / APIs

To do some rough profiling around response time, you can use `ab` - apache benchmark.

This will send a total of 1000 requests, 10 at a time to `http://www.something.com/`.

```
ab -n 1000 -c 10 -g something.tsv http://www.something.com/
```

`-g` means each response is listed separately, and the file is tab separated.

```
starttime	seconds	ctime	dtime	ttime	wait
Wed Apr 15 18:54:11 2015	1429149251	1	147	148	147
Wed Apr 15 18:54:11 2015	1429149251	0	152	152	152
Wed Apr 15 18:54:11 2015	1429149251	1	152	153	152
...
```

`-e` would be comma separated and would have to requests binned by the time it
took to complete that percent of requests.

```
Percentage served,Time in ms
0,117.436
1,117.436
2,120.811
3,120.811
...
```

Of course each format is useful for different things, so don't restrict yourself:

```
ab -n 1000 -c 10 -e something.csv -g something.tsv http://www.something.com/
```

Additionally you get a summary of the requests.

You can use gnuplot to visualize:

You can place multiple outputs on the same graph. This is useful for comparing
before and afters, or showing degradation as concurrency increases.

It is possible to send data, headers, and cookies with requests.
