# Grunt-init

Initially we used grunt for all of our scaffolding, build, and deploy needs. Now
we tend to use grunt for tasks that involve configuration files or scaffolding only.
For our day to day dev workflow we tend to use Gulp - or just Node itself,
since it is much faster. This has the nice side effect of separating the files
needed for dev workflow from the files needed for builds, deploy, and scaffolding.
